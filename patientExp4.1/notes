-COMPLETED: Email verification for the sendout email address works. Sends email, containing a link which will verify (change N to Y in db) that email via registrationId / tempId, to the entered email address from the 'admin_edit_mailer' page.
--actually need to change the sendemail function to use new email;

July 1 2018
-registerMailer does not store password encrypted in db; in the code, the mailer email is not encrypted/hashed either; not sure how to set mailer password if its hashed in the db; sendEmail function uses password of email in free-text;
-COMPLETED: Work on implementing the changed mailer email address so emails come from that set email
-COMPLETED: Work on find_user / password reset
-eventually need to move functions out of pes-app.js, put in separate files that make sense.

July 2 2018
-COMPLETED: Working on implementing newly set mailer email address; sends email from pesa.testing if newly set mailer email is not real/existing

July 3 2018
-COMPLETED: Working on password reset; had to change "action" on reset_password page dynamically so that POST works with different registrationIds in the href;

July 4 2018
-Working on patients page / main interface;
--patients page needs to have action=URL updated

July 6 2018
-COMPLETED: Work on populating the profile of users
-COMPLETED: took out some profile elements (password, securityQ)
-Working on having user's recipients list loaded pertaining to their own (ie. each user's recipients list will be different instead of having all recipients from patients table);


July 17 2018
-COMPLETED: Chaned users email_verified status to 'Y' when user verifies

July 18 2018
-Added functionality block to users who do not have their email addresses verified
-Removed Admin tab for non-admins (will appear for administrator account only)
-Working on resetting sessions... (currently out of scope?)

July 19, 2018
-Changing database schema: recipients table;
-The recipients tab will be revamped: adding recipient will redirect to new page; tab will show all recipients in a table; this is because of POSTing issues (posting affects sendSurvey)
-added main_interface.js for /patients/user page (not used atm);

July 20, 2018
-Working on session bugs (trying to fix logout button; redirecting to login should reset/destroy current session)

July 21, 2018
-Working on session bugs and logout function;
-Users are able to add recipients to their recipient list!
-Updated "Manage Recipients" tab to match mockup;

July 22, 2018
-Adding recipient will check if the recipient already exists in the user's recipient list, and will not add if true
-Finished getting recipients loaded onto sendSurvey tab;
-Did lots of CSS work (table, li)
-added content for admin interface (needs functionality)

--Goals--
2. Sending of survey needs to be fixed
3. Adding recipients need to be fixed
4. personalized recipients for user needs to work (think about changes to db schema)
5. Ability to re-send verification email

--out of scope but nice to have--
1. admin_start page will always redirect to admin_edit_mailer; if we reuse admin_start page to edit admin information, then it shouldnt redirect to mailer; redirects to mailer ONLY if no mailer is set.
2. admin_edit_mailer page: redirects to login even if set email is invalid; page should not redirect, or at least notify user of invalidity;
3. Reset password uses only an emailed link including the user's registrationId; Add security question + answer here, too?
4. Password reset has to set requirements of password;
5. Work for mailerEmailVerify, ONLY WORKS IF USING GMAIL as service; hotmail does not work!
6. POST admin_start: need to verify the admin account!
7. User should not be allowed to set the default mailer email on the admin_edit_mailer page!
8. Password reset will look like it worked even if the registrationId in the URL is invalid!!!
9. Logout button not functioning properly: brings to login page, but using incorrect function;
