-COMPLETED: Email verification for the sendout email address works. Sends email, containing a link which will verify (change N to Y in db) that email via registrationId / tempId, to the entered email address from the 'admin_edit_mailer' page.
--actually need to change the sendemail function to use new email;

July 1 2018
-registerMailer does not store password encrypted in db; in the code, the mailer email is not encrypted/hashed either; not sure how to set mailer password if its hashed in the db; sendEmail function uses password of email in free-text;
-COMPLETED: Work on implementing the changed mailer email address so emails come from that set email
-COMPLETED: Work on find_user / password reset
-eventually need to move functions out of pes-app.js, put in separate files that make sense.

July 2 2018
-COMPLETED: Working on implementing newly set mailer email address; sends email from pesa.testing if newly set mailer email is not real/existing

July 3 2018
-COMPLETED: Working on password reset; had to change "action" on reset_password page dynamically so that POST works with different registrationIds in the href;

July 4 2018
-Working on patients page / main interface;
--patients page needs to have action=URL updated

July 6 2018
-COMPLETED: Work on populating the profile of users
-COMPLETED: took out some profile elements (password, securityQ)
-Working on having user's recipients list loaded pertaining to their own (ie. each user's recipients list will be different instead of having all recipients from patients table);


July 17 2018
-COMPLETED: Chaned users email_verified status to 'Y' when user verifies

July 18 2018
-Added functionality block to users who do not have their email addresses verified
-Removed Admin tab for non-admins (will appear for administrator account only)
-Working on resetting sessions... (currently out of scope?)

July 19, 2018
-Changing database schema: recipients table;
-The recipients tab will be revamped: adding recipient will redirect to new page; tab will show all recipients in a table; this is because of POSTing issues (posting affects sendSurvey)
-added main_interface.js for /patients/user page (not used atm);

July 20, 2018
-Working on session bugs (trying to fix logout button; redirecting to login should reset/destroy current session)

July 21, 2018
-Working on session bugs and logout function;
-Users are able to add recipients to their recipient list!
-Updated "Manage Recipients" tab to match mockup;

July 22, 2018
-Adding recipient will check if the recipient already exists in the user's recipient list, and will not add if true
-Finished getting recipients loaded onto sendSurvey tab;
-Did lots of CSS work (table, li)
-added content for admin interface (needs functionality)

July 23, 2018

July 24, 2018
-Work on info messages display for main interface

July 26-27, 2018
-Working on logout function (bug fixing)
-Fixed database schema (recipients table not corresponding to code)
-Working on minor changes for deployment on server
-Need to fix email links because it starts with localhost:3003

July 30, 2018
-Fixed logout functionality
-Only admin is able to access admin_start and edit_mailer pages now
-Working on implementing opt out of receiving surveys functionality for recipients

July 31, 2018
-Opt out survey function
-Implemented email verification resend functionality for non-verified users;

Aug 01, 2018
-surveySendEmail now functional! Recipients can now receive the survey;
-Recipients are now able to go through the entire survey!

--Goals--
opt-out functionality

--out of scope but nice to have--
1. admin_start page will always redirect to admin_edit_mailer; if we reuse admin_start page to edit admin information, then it shouldnt redirect to mailer; redirects to mailer ONLY if no mailer is set.
2. admin_edit_mailer page: redirects to login even if set email is invalid; page should not redirect, or at least notify user of invalidity;
3. Reset password uses only an emailed link including the user's registrationId; Add security question + answer here, too?
5. Work for mailerEmailVerify, ONLY WORKS IF USING GMAIL as service; hotmail does not work!
8. Password reset will look like it worked even if the registrationId in the URL is invalid!!!
9. Logout button not functioning properly: brings to login page, but using incorrect function;
10. Mailer table password..
11. Mailer email verification no functionality

--Deploying onto server--
SSH to students.healthinformaticshub.ca while on the school network. Enter in credentials for team3; copy the project
folder onto team3; install all dependencies; mysql command: mysql -u pesApp03 -p (requires password); create the tables;
make sure to add 'use pesdb3'; quit; npm install nodemailer@1.0.0 (because error prevents app from running);
when ready, enter command: 'node app.js'; follow error messages if it doesn't run;
