Email verification for the sendout email address works. Sends email, containing a link which will verify (change N to Y in db) that email via registrationId / tempId, to the entered email address from the 'admin_edit_mailer' page.
--actually need to change the sendemail function to use new email;

July 1 2018
-registerMailer does not store password encrypted in db; in the code, the mailer email is not encrypted/hashed either; not sure how to set mailer password if its hashed in the db; sendEmail function uses password of email in free-text;
-Work on implementing the changed mailer email address so emails come from that set email
-Work on find_user / password reset
-eventually need to move functions out of pes-app.js, put in separate files that make sense.

July 2 2018
-Working on implementing newly set mailer email address; sends email from pesa.testing if newly set mailer email is not real/existing

July 3 2018
-Working on password reset; had to change "action" on reset_password page dynamically so that POST works with different registrationIds in the href;

July 4 2018
-Working on patients page / main interface;
--patients page needs to have action=URL updated

July 6 2018
-Work on populating the profile of users
--took out some profile elements (password, securityQ)
-Working on having user's recipients list loaded pertaining to their own (ie. each user's recipients list will be different instead of having all recipients from patients table);

--Things to fix/add--
1. admin_start page will always redirect to admin_edit_mailer; if we reuse admin_start page to edit admin information, then it shouldnt redirect to mailer; redirects to mailer ONLY if no mailer is set.
2. admin_edit_mailer page: redirects to login even if set email is invalid; page should not redirect, or at least notify user of invalidity;
3. Reset password uses only an emailed link including the user's registrationId; Add security question + answer here, too?
4. Password reset has to set requirements;
5. Work for mailerEmailVerify, ONLY WORKS IF USING GMAIL as service; hotmail does not work!
6. POST admin_start: need to verify the admin account!
7. User should not be allowed to set the default mailer email on the admin_edit_mailer page!
8. Password reset will look like it worked even if the registrationId in the URL is invalid!!!
9. Logout button not functioning properly: brings to login page, but using incorrect function;
